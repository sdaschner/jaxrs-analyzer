= JAX-RS Analyzer
Sebastian Daschner

The JAX-RS Analyzer generates an overview of all JAX-RS resources in a JavaEE project.
Besides other approaches this tool uses Bytecode analysis to maximise the extracted information.

The Analyzer is available as https://github.com/sdaschner/jaxrs-analyzer-maven-plugin/[Maven plugin] or standalone version (executable jar file).

== Quickstart (tl;dr)
Just add the latest release version of the JAX-RS Analyzer to your Maven pom.xml in the `<plugins>`-section:

----
<plugin>
    <groupId>com.sebastian-daschner</groupId>
    <artifactId>jaxrs-analyzer-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>0.17</version>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <goals>
                <goal>analyze-jaxrs</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
                <backend>swagger</backend>
            </configuration>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>

== Maven Plugin
Please see the https://github.com/sdaschner/jaxrs-analyzer-maven-plugin[Maven plugin project] and a https://github.com/sdaschner/jaxrs-analyzer-maven-plugin/blob/master/Documentation.adoc[documentation] of all parameters.

== Standalone
Instead of using the Maven plugin, the tool can also run directly from the jar file.

You can download the latest version https://github.com/sdaschner/jaxrs-analyzer/releases[here].
Alternatively the executable can be build with `mvn clean install`.

Run the jar file with `java -jar jaxrs-analyzer.jar [options] <projectPathToCompiledClasses> [projectPathToCompiledClasses...]`, e.g. `java -jar jaxrs-analyzer.jar -b swagger ../yourProject/target/classes`.

The `projectPath` entries may be directories or jar files containing the classes to be analyzed.

Following available options:

* `-b <backend>` The backend to choose: `swagger` (default), `plaintext`, `asciidoc`, `markdown`
* `-cp <class path>[:class paths...]` The additional class paths containing classes which are used in the project (separated by colon); this may be directories or jar-files
* `-X` Debug enabled (prints error debugging information on Standard error out)
* `-n <project name>` The name of the project
* `-v <project version>` The version of the project
* `-d <project domain>` The domain of the project
* `-o <output file>` The location of the analysis output (will be printed to standard out if omitted)

Following available backend specific options (only have effect if the corresponding backend is selected):

* `--swaggerSchemes <scheme>[,schemes]` The Swagger schemes: `http` (default), `https`, `ws`, `wss`
* `--renderSwaggerTags` Enables rendering of Swagger tags (default tag will be used per default)
* `--swaggerTagsPathOffset <path offset>` The number at which path position the Swagger tags will be extracted (0 will be used per default)
* `--ignoredRootResources <fully qualified classname [class,...]>` JAX-RS root resource classes which should be ignored by analyze (empty per default). Note that these ignores only cause the classes to be ignored as root resources; they might still be taken into account as JAX-RS sub-resources.

== Backends
The Analyzer supports Plaintext, AsciiDoc, Markdown and Swagger as output format.
The latter three can be processed further.

AsciiDoc and Markdown are human-readable, lightweight markup languages.
They can easily converted to PDF, HTML, and many more.

The Swagger JSON file can be used with Swagger UI or the http://editor.swagger.io[Swagger Editor].

 Swagger UI is a dependency-free collection of HTML, Javascript, and CSS assets that dynamically generate beautiful documentation from a Swagger-compliant API.
