= JAX-RS Analyzer
Sebastian Daschner

Generates an overview of all JAX-RS resources in a project by bytecode analysis.

*Yet another such JAX-RS tool?* +
Yes, but this gathers the information about the JAX-RS resource classes by bytecode analysis (not just by reflection).
This gains more information in several situations. You don't need additional annotations on your JAX-RS resource methods.
Using the JSR 339 standard is sufficient.

Java 8 is needed for the Analyzer.

For usage see the https://github.com/sdaschner/jaxrs-analyzer/blob/master/Documentation.adoc[documentation].

== Maven Plugin
The Analyzer can be added to your project via https://github.com/sdaschner/jaxrs-analyzer-maven-plugin[Maven plugin].

== Gradle Plugin
For `Gradle` based projects - third-party https://github.com/eshepelyuk/gradle-jaxrs-analyzer-plugin[Gradle plugin] could be used.

== Standalone
Instead of using the Maven plugin, the tool can also run directly from the jar file.
You can download the latest version https://github.com/sdaschner/jaxrs-analyzer/releases[here].

== Backends
The Analyzer supports Plaintext, AsciiDoc and Swagger as output format.

== Annotations for Type Analyzer
By default JAXB annotations and visibility rules will determine which fields will be serialized to JSON.
Alternatively Jackson annotations can be used which will then determine visibility as well as adhere to property names
as specified by the @JsonProperty("my_property_name") annotation.
